## 🏆 **Showcasing My Expertise**

🔹 **Optimized Solidity smart contracts** 🔥🔹 **DNAHashGenerator** – Securely generating deterministic hashes.🔹 **DeFi Protocol Simulations** – Testing governance, lending, and staking mechanisms.🔹 **Gas Optimization Techniques** – Reducing contract execution costs.🔹 **Security Research** – Preventing re-entrancy, integer overflows, and other attack vectors.

---

## 🚀 **Current Project: DNAHashGenerator**

The DNAHashGenerator contract allows the owner to generate and store a unique DNA hash based on user input. Users can also retrieve their own stored DNA.

### **🔹 Features:**

✔️ Generates an immutable DNA hash using `keccak256` hashing.✔️ Prevents duplicate DNA storage for the same address.✔️ Provides input validation to block empty submissions.✔️ Allows the contract owner to delete DNA records.✔️ Optimized gas usage by reducing unnecessary storage operations.

📌 More projects coming soon! Stay tuned. 💡

## 🚀 **Current Project: Random DNA Generator**  
The first project in this repository generates a unique DNA hash based on user input.  

### **🔹 Features:**  
✔️ Generates an immutable DNA hash using `keccak256` hashing.  
✔️ Emits an event to notify external applications when a new DNA is created.  
✔️ Demonstrates randomness generation using Solidity’s `abi.encodePacked`.
