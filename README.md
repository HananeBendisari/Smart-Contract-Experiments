# 🛠 Blockchain Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Blockchain Development Journey!** This repository documents my progress as I build innovative smart contracts and explore the frontiers of decentralized finance (**DeFi**), security, and **Web3 development**.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is a **structured collection of my hands-on projects**, showcasing advanced smart contract development, security best practices, and real-world DeFi applications.

## 🚀 **Current Project: DNAHashGenerator**

The DNAHashGenerator contract allows the owner to generate and store a unique DNA hash based on user input. Users can also retrieve their own stored DNA.

### **🔹 Features:**

✔️ Generates an immutable DNA hash using `keccak256` hashing.\
✔️ Prevents duplicate DNA storage for the same address.\
✔️ Provides input validation to block empty submissions.\
✔️ Allows the contract owner to delete DNA records.\
✔️ Optimized gas usage by reducing unnecessary storage operations.

📌 More projects coming soon! Stay tuned. 💡

## 📊 **Project Activity**

📍 **Contract deployed on Sepolia Testnet**: `0x4111c3cB4d4794A2C6d17690D4e467F327ae630b`
🔗 **[View on Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4111c3cB4d4794A2C6d17690D4e467F327ae630b)**

### **🔹 Interacting with the contract:**
1. **Using Remix:**
   - Open [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Select `Injected Provider - MetaMask` under "Deploy & Run Transactions".
   - Paste the contract address `0x4111c3cB4d4794A2C6d17690D4e467F327ae630b` and interact with the functions.

2. **Using Etherscan:**
   - Go to [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4111c3cB4d4794A2C6d17690D4e467F327ae630b).
   - Click on "Contract" > "Write Contract" to interact directly with the functions.
