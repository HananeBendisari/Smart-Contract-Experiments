## 🚀 **Current Project: Random DNA Generator**  
The first project in this repository generates a unique DNA hash based on user input.  

### **🔹 Features:**  
✔️ Generates an immutable DNA hash using `keccak256` hashing.  
✔️ Emits an event to notify external applications when a new DNA is created.  
✔️ Demonstrates randomness generation using Solidity’s `abi.encodePacked`.  

📌 More projects coming soon! Stay tuned. 💡
